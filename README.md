# Cts-Hackothon

Welcome to our project update! We're thrilled to share that we're currently in the process of creating a video MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that promises to revolutionize the way we experience content. Our dedicated team is working diligently to craft a prototype that showcases the core functionalities and unique features of our concept. While it's still in the development phase, we're excited to offer you a sneak peek into our vision. With a little more time and effort, we're confident that we'll be able to transform this prototype into a fully functional working model that will not only meet but exceed expectations. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue on this exciting journey of innovation and creativity!
